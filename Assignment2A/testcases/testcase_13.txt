#Test Case 13: Dead-End and Backtracking
#A test to assess how algorithms handle dead-end paths that do not lead to any goal.
#Predicted outcome:
#DFS may explore deep into dead-ends before backtracking.
#BFS, UCS, and A* should systematically avoid or recover from dead-ends.
#Confirms correct backtracking and frontier management.
