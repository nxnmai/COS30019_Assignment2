# Test Case 6: Deceptive Heuristic Path
# A test to analyze how heuristic-based algorithms behave when the heuristic is misleading.
# Predicted outcome:
# - GBFS is expected to choose a geometrically closer but higher-cost path.
# - UCS and A* should correctly identify the lowest-cost route.
# - Demonstrates the limitation of purely heuristic-driven search.
