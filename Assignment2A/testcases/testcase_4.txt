# Test Case 4: Equal-Cost Optimal Paths with Node-ID Tie Breaking
# A test to examine how algorithms resolve ties when multiple optimal paths have identical total costs.
# Predicted outcome:
# UCS and A* should select the path that expands the node with the lower node ID first.
# BFS and DFS should follow traversal order while remaining consistent with ascending node ID rules.
# Validates correct implementation of node-ID tie-breaking.
