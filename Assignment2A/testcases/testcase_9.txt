#Test Case 9: Multiple Destinations with an Unreachable Preferred Goal
#A test to ensure algorithms correctly handle multiple destinations when the most promising goal is unreachable.
#Predicted outcome:
#Algorithms must detect that the preferred destination cannot be reached and continue searching.
#All valid algorithms should eventually reach an alternative destination.
#Confirms robustness in goal evaluation logic.
