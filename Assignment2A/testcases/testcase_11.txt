#Test Case 11: Isolated Destination Node (No Valid Path)
#A test where the destination node is completely disconnected from the origin.
#Predicted outcome:
#All algorithms should terminate gracefully and report that no valid path exists.
#No algorithm should enter an infinite loop or crash.
#Confirms proper handling of unsolvable search problems.
