#Test Case 2: Cycle with Directed Exit
#A test to evaluate how search algorithms handle cycles in a directed graph where only one valid exit exists.
#Predicted outcome:
#UCS, A*, and BFS should escape the cycle and reach the destination using correct loop handling.
#DFS may explore deeper into the cycle before finding the exit, depending on expansion order.
#GBFS may initially follow heuristic cues but must avoid infinite looping.
#Confirms correct cycle prevention while respecting edge direction.
