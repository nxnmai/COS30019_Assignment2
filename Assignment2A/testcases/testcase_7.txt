# Test Case 7: Least Cost versus Least Moves
# A test to distinguish between cost-optimal and step-optimal search strategies.
# Predicted outcome:
# - UCS and A* will choose a longer path with lower cumulative cost.
# - BFS and CUS2 (least-moves strategy) will prefer a shorter path with fewer steps despite higher cost.
# - Clearly illustrates the conceptual difference between UCS and CUS2.
