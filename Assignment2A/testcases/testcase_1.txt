# Test Case 1: Simple Baseline Path (Sanity Check)
# A minimal linear graph used to verify basic functionality and correct input parsing.
# Predicted outcome:
# All algorithms should successfully find the only valid path to the destination.
# Confirms correct parsing of nodes, edges, origin, and destination.
# Any failure here indicates a fundamental implementation error.
