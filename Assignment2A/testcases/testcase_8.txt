# Test Case 8: Same Edge Costs across All Paths
# A test where all edges have identical traversal costs.
# Predicted outcome:
# - UCS behavior should resemble BFS in terms of chosen path length.
# - Tie-breaking rules (node ID and chronological order) become the deciding factors.
# - Useful for validating consistent expansion ordering.
