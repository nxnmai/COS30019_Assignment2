# Test Case 3: Directed Edges and One-Way Trap
# A test designed to ensure algorithms strictly respect edge directionality.
# Predicted outcome:
# Algorithms must not traverse edges in the reverse direction unless explicitly defined.
# UCS and A* should compute correct paths and costs using directed edges only.
# Detects incorrect assumptions that the graph is undirected.
