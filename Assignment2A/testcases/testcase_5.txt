# Test Case 5: Chronological Tie Resolution across Branches
# A test to verify correct expansion order when nodes from different branches have equal priority values.
# Predicted outcome:
# - When cost, heuristic, and node ID are equal, nodes added earlier to the frontier must be expanded first.
# - UCS, A*, and GBFS should preserve insertion order.
# - Identifies bugs related to priority queue handling without chronological indexing.
